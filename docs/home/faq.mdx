## Streaming

<AccordionGroup>
	<Accordion title="Bandwidth requirements">
   To ensure optimal performance of Hyperbeam virtual computers, it is recommended that your users meet the following bandwidth requirements. Even though users who have less bandwidth available can still stream virtual computers, the image quality or framerate may be suboptimal.
    ```html
    | Resolution | Framerate | Bandwidth Required |
    | ---------- | --------- | ------------------ |
    | 720p       | 24fps     | 5mbps              |
    | 720p       | 30fps     | 6.3mbps            |
    | 900p       | 24fps     | 7.8mbps            |
    | 900p       | 30fps     | 9.8mbps            |
    | 1080p      | 24fps     | 11.3mbps           |
    | 1080p      | 30fps     | 14.1mbps           |
    ```
    <Warning>Enabling **sharp mode** triples these bandwidth requirements.</Warning>

## Monitoring

<AccordionGroup>
	<Accordion title="Can I detect when a user changes the URL in the virtual browser?">
    Yes, you can detect when a user changes the virtual browser URL by using [Hyperbeamâ€™s tab event listener API](/client/web-sdk/examples#listen-to-tab-events) available in our Web SDK.
    We do not currently provide a way to directly detect this action server-side.

## Proxies

<AccordionGroup>
	<Accordion title="Is there an IP range I can use to whitelist Hyperbeam servers?">
    Not at the moment. Hyperbeam uses a variety of server providers which makes it difficult to whitelist Hyperbeam servers based on IP. You can use username/password authentication to ensure traffic originates from Hyperbeam.
	</Accordion>
	<Accordion title="Where do I put the credentials in FindProxyForURL?">
    ```json
    {
      "http_proxy": {
        "pac": "function FindProxyForURL(url, host) {return {'PROXY 255.255.255.255:12345'}",
        "username": "<username>",
        "password": "<password>"
      }
    }
    ```
    Relevant MDN docs: [Proxy Auto-Configuration (PAC) file](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Proxy_servers_and_tunneling/Proxy_Auto-Configuration_PAC_file)
    <Warning>
      Caveats:
      - Only HTTP traffic is sent through the proxy server. WebRTC traffic is excluded. Hence, there is no functional difference between the use of SOCKS, HTTP or HTTPS protocol on the proxy server.
      - Authentication is not supported for SOCKS protocol. This is due to it not being implemented by Chrome.
      - Due to these reasons, we recommend the usage of HTTPS to authenticate and secure communication between Hyperbeam and the proxy server: [HTTPS Proxy Scheme.](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/HEAD/net/docs/proxy.md#HTTPS-proxy-scheme)
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
	<Accordion title="My API request fails due to CORS">
    Requests to the Hyperbeam API should not be made from the client as doing so exposes your
    API key to users which can easily be abused. Instead, API requests should only be
    made from a backend such as Vercel, Netlify or Cloudflare.
