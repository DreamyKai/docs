## Server

For a resizable browser window, you need to specify the following properties when [creating a new browser instance](/start-chromium-session).

<Param body="width" type="number" default="1280">
  The initial width of the browser window in pixels.
</Param>

<Param body="height" type="number" default="720">
  The initial height of the browser window in pixels.
</Param>

<Param body="max_area" type="number" default="1280*720">
  The maximum browser window area in pixels. <br /> This limits the browser
  window size when resizing the window.
</Param>

## Client

To resize the browser window, call the [resize](#hb-resize-width-height) function with the desired width and height.

<Warning>
  Instead of calling the [resize](#hb-resize-width-height) function on a
  [drag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/drag_event)
  event, call it on the
  [dragend](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/dragend_event),
  [mouseup](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/mouseup_event),
  or
  [touchend](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/touchend_event)
  events. <br />
  This will prevent unnecessary calls to the server and improve performance.
</Warning>

### hb.resize(width, height)

The `resize` method on the [Hyperbeam client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hyperbeam/web) allows you to resize and reposition the browser window dynamically. This can be useful for creating a custom sized browser window for your app or adapting to different screen sizes.

<Param body="width" type="number" required>
  The width of the browser window in pixels.
</Param>

<Param body="height" type="number" required>
  The height of the browser window in pixels.
</Param>

### hb.maxArea

The `maxArea` property on the [Hyperbeam client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hyperbeam/web) stores the maximum browser window area in pixels. This is the maximum area that the browser window can be resized to, and is set by the `max_area` property when creating a new browser instance.

```js
console.log(hb.maxArea); // 921600 (1280 * 720)
```
