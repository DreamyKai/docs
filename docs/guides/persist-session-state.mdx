title: "Persist Session State"
description: ""
---

The Hyperbeam profile API allows you to persist session state including bookmarks, history,
passwords, and cookies which can be loaded into another session at a later time. This
allows you to resume sessions without requiring the user to open up web pages or
authenticate again.

## Saving a Session

In order to save a session, the `profile.save` parameter must be set to `true` when
[starting a Chromium session](/rest-api/dispatch/start-chromium-session).

### Example Request:

```curl
curl --request POST \
     --url https://engine.hyperbeam.com/v0/vm \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer AUTH_VALUE' \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data '{
 "profile": {
  "save": true
 }
}'
```

After the session is created, the response object will contain a `session_id` property that you must save
in order to load the session state again afterwards.

<Info>
  If you wish to save a session that was already persisted, you do not need to
  store the new `session_id` in your database. Instead, you can use the initial
  session's `session_id` to load/save that session. Therefore, you do not need
  to continually update the `session_id` corresponding to the session.
</Info>

### Example Response:

```json
{
  "session_id": "52f968cb-6739-4197-83d7-2305fe5d6f54",
  "embed_url": "https://vwdrccwgpv181powg61ggyvy.hyperbeam.com/Uvloy2c5QZeD1yMF_l1vVA?token=c8iw3SmQglOU0ugfLr3dWY2LalSKI_WOGUldEt8knbw",
  "admin_token": "51JOZEEcMp4trCwbpTS3jjQc0lSmeAZpPfxioDqe73U"
}
```

## Loading a Session

In order to load a previous session, the `profile.load` parameter must be set to the `session_id` you would like to resume
when [starting a Chromium session](/rest-api/dispatch/start-chromium-session).

### Example Request:

```curl
curl --request POST \
     --url https://engine.hyperbeam.com/v0/vm \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer AUTH_VALUE' \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data '{
 "profile": {
  "load": <session_id>
 }
}'
```

## How Do We Persist Sessions?

When `profile.save` is set to `true`, we encrypt and store the Chrome profile of the session in Amazon S3.

This Chrome profile is associated with the `session_id` that was returned to you on session creation.

When `profile.load` is set to a session ID, we look for a stored Chrome profile that corresponds to that `session_id`, and decrypt and
load the Chrome profile if there is a match.

This results in bookmarks, history, cookies, and passwords being persisted.
