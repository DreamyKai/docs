Timeouts determine when a session will be automatically terminated.
They can be used to prevent excessive usage, terminate inactive sessions,
add paywalls, and more.

## Types of Timeouts

There are three types of timeouts:

1. Absolute timeout
2. Offline timeout
3. Inactive timeout

### üõë Absolute Timeout

The absolute timeout is the amount of time (in seconds) after
session creation before the virtual browser is automatically terminated.
It is primarily used to enforce hard limits on session time.

### üí§ Offline Timeout

The offline timeout is the amount of time (in seconds) that no users
have been connected, after which the virtual browser is automatically
terminated. It is used to terminate sessions where all users have disconnected.

### üëª Inactive Timeout

The inactive timeout is the amount of time (in seconds) since the
last user input, after which the virtual browser is automatically
terminated. It is used to terminate sessions where users remain connected
but are not necessarily using the virtual browser.

You can programmatically reset the inactive timeout using
[`hb.ping()](https://docs.hyperbeam.com/client-sdk/javascript/reference#ping).

## Default Values

| Timeout    | Default Value (in seconds) |
| ---------- | -------------------------- |
| Offline    | 3600                       |
| Inactive   | null                       |
| Absolute   | null                       |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning Value

You can provide a callback, `onCloseWarning`,
which can be used used to notify the user of an upcoming timeout.

```js
const hb = await Hyperbeam(hbContainer, computer.embed_url, {
  onCloseWarning(e) {
    if (e.deadline) {
      showCloseWarning(e.type, e.deadline.delay);
    } else {
      hideCloseWarning(e.type);
    }
  }
});
```

The warning value is the amount of time (in seconds) between
`onCloseWarning` being called and the session being terminated.
Its default value is `60`.

## How to Set Timeout Values

You can set timeout values during [session creation](/rest-api/dispatch/start-chromium-session) by setting the `timeout`
object parameter.

```curl
curl --request POST \
     --url https://engine.hyperbeam.com/v0/vm \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer AUTH_VALUE' \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data '{
 "timeout": {
  "absolute": 1000,
  "inactive": 100,
  "offline": 3600,
  "warning": 60,
  "webhook": {
   "url": "<webhook url>",
   "bearer": "<webhook auth>""
  }
 },
}'
```

### Webhooks

The Hyperbeam timeout system allows you to send webhook events when a timeout is triggered. To use webhooks, add the `webhook.url` and `webhook.bearer` parameters to the request when [starting a session](https://docs.hyperbeam.com/rest-api/dispatch/start-chromium-session) (see example above).

## Updating Timeouts for Active Sessions

You can update timeouts for active sessions by hitting the `<base_url>/timeout` endpoint, and passing in new timeout values.

<Note>
  When you update the timeouts, the timeout counters are reset e.g. absolute
  timeout will calculate the amount of time from the timeout update (instead of
  session creation) before the session is terminated. To prevent the timeout
  counters from being reset, you must set the `reset` parameter to `false` (see
  example request).
</Note>

### Example Request

```curl
curl --request POST \
     --url <base_url>/timeout \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer AUTH_VALUE' \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data '{
  "absolute": 1000,
  "inactive": 100,
  "offline": 3600,
  "warning": 60,
  "reset": false
}'
```
