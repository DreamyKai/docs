### Parameters

<Param body="priority" type="integer" default={0}>
  Higher value = higher priority. Users with a higher priority will preempt the
  control of lower priority users.
</Param>

<Param body="idle_timeout" type="integer" default={0}>
  Number of milliseconds until a user is considered "idle". Once a user is
  considered idle, they no longer preempt lower priority users until they
  interact with the multiplayer browser again.
</Param>

<Param
  body="control_disabled"
  type="boolean"
  default="{control_disable_default}"
>
  If control_disabled = true, all control input (mouse movements, keyboard
  presses) will be ignored. Note that disabling control does not restrict access
  to any APIs that require admin tokens.
</Param>
