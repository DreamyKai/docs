title: Install Custom Chrome Extension
---

You can create a custom [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions) and install it on the virtual browser. Both `zip` and `crx` file formats are supported. A few gotchas:

- The content-type is multipart/form-data rather than application/json
- The body field must be set to the JSON request data
- The field you passed into `{"extension": "foo"}` must contain the path to the extension file and the file's MIME type, separated by a semi-colon
  - For example, `{"extension": "a"}` and `--form 'a=@/path/to/ext.crx;application/x-chrome-extension`

## Install custom Chrome extension

### crx file

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
  https://engine.hyperbeam.com/v0/vm \
  --form 'body={"ublock":true,"extension":{"field":"ex"}}' \
  --form 'ex=@/tmp/ext.crx;type=application/x-chrome-extension'
```

### zip file

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
  https://engine.hyperbeam.com/v0/vm \
  --form 'body={"ublock":true,"extension":{"field":"ex"}}' \
  --form 'ex=@/tmp/ext.zip;type=application/zip'
```
